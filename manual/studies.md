# Studies

This section analyzes the estimators' properties using mathematical proofs and Monte Carlo simulations.
Most proofs are adopted from various textbooks and papers, but only the most essential references are provided.

Unlike the main part of the manual, studies require knowledge of classic statistical methods.
Well-known facts and commonly accepted notation are used without special introduction.
The studies provide a deep dive into properties of considered estimators for practitioners interested in rigorous proofs and results of numerical simulations.
