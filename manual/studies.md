# Studies

This section analyzes the estimators' properties using mathematical proofs and Monte Carlo simulations.
Most proofs are adopted from various textbooks and research papers, but only essential references are provided.

Unlike the main part of the manual, the studies require knowledge of classic statistical methods.
Well-known facts and commonly accepted notation are used without special introduction.
The studies provide detailed analysis of estimator properties for practitioners
  interested in rigorous proofs and numerical simulation results.
