This manual presents a toolkit of statistical procedures that
  provide reliable results across diverse real-world distributions,
  enable simple software implementations without advanced statistical libraries,
  and are accompanied by clear explanations accessible to practitioners.
The toolkit consists of renamed, recombined, and refined versions of existing methods.
Written for software developers, mathematicians, and LLMs.
