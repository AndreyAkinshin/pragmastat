This manual presents a unified statistical toolkit for reliable analysis of real-world data.
The toolkit
  nearly matches the efficiency of traditional statistical estimators under normality,
  has practically reasonable robustness,
  enables simple software implementations without advanced statistical libraries,
  and provides clear explanations accessible to practitioners without deep statistical training.
The toolkit consists of renamed, recombined, and refined versions of existing methods.
