## Breakdown

Heavy-tailed distributions naturally produce extreme outliers that completely distort traditional estimators.
A single extreme measurement from the $\Power$ distribution can make the sample mean arbitrarily large.
Real-world data can also contain corrupted measurements from instrument failures, recording errors, or transmission problems.
Both natural extremes and data corruption create the same challenge:
  extracting reliable information when some measurements are too influential.

The breakdown point is the fraction of a sample that can be replaced by arbitrarily large values
  without making an estimator arbitrarily large.
The theoretical maximum is $50\%$; no estimator can guarantee reliable results
  when more than half the measurements are extreme or corrupted.
In such cases, summary estimators are not applicable, and a more sophisticated approach is needed.

A $50\%$ breakdown point is rarely needed in practice, as more conservative values also cover practical needs.
Additionally, a high breakdown point corresponds to low precision
  (information is lost by neglecting part of the data).
The optimal practical breakdown point should be between
  $0\%$ (no robustness) and $50\%$ (low precision).

The $\Center$ and $\Spread$ estimators achieve $29\%$ breakdown points,
  providing substantial protection against realistic contamination levels
  while maintaining good precision.
Below is a comparison with traditional estimators.

**Asymptotic breakdown points** for average estimators:

| $\Mean$ | $\Median$ | $\Center$ |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 0%      | 50%       | 29%       |

**Asymptotic breakdown points** for dispersion estimators:

| $\StdDev$ | $\MAD$ | $\Spread$ |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 0%        | 50%    | 29%       |
