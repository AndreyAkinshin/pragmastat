## Uniform

$$
\Uniform(\mathrm{min}, \mathrm{max})
$$

- $\mathrm{min}$: lower bound of the support interval
- $\mathrm{max}$: upper bound of the support interval ($\mathrm{max} > \mathrm{min}$)

- **Formation:** all values within a bounded interval have equal probability.
- **Origin:** represents complete uncertainty within known bounds.
- **Properties:** rectangular probability density, finite support with hard boundaries.
- **Applications:** random number generation, round-off errors, arrival times within known intervals.
- **Characteristics:** symmetric, bounded, no tail behavior.
- **Note:** traditional estimators work reasonably well due to symmetry and bounded nature.
