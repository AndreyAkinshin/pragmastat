= Studies

This section analyzes the estimators' properties using mathematical proofs.
Most proofs are adapted from various textbooks and research papers, but only essential references are provided.

Unlike the main part of the manual, the studies require knowledge of classic statistical methods.
Well-known facts and commonly accepted notation are used without special introduction.
The studies provide detailed analyses of estimator properties for practitioners
  interested in rigorous proofs and numerical simulation results.
