## Breaking changes

Statistical practice has evolved through decades of research and teaching,
  creating a system where historical naming conventions became embedded in textbooks and standard practice.
Traditional statistics often names procedures after their discoverers or uses arbitrary symbols
  that reveal nothing about their actual purpose or application context.
This approach forces practitioners to memorize meaningless mappings between historical figures and mathematical concepts.

The result is unnecessary friction for anyone learning or applying statistical methods.
Beginners face an inconsistent landscape of confusing names, fragile defaults,
  and incompatible approaches with little guidance on selection or interpretation.
Modern practitioners would benefit from a more consistent system, which requires some renaming and redefining.
This manual offers a coherent system designed for clarity and practical use, breaking from tradition.
The following concepts were adopted from traditional textbooks via renaming or reworking:

- Estimators
  - Average: $\Center$ (former 'Hodges-Lehmann location estimator')
  - Dispersion: $\Spread$ (former 'Shamos scale estimator')
  - Effect Size: $\Disparity$ (a robust alternative to 'Cohen's $d$')
- Estimator properties
  - Precision: $\Drift$ (a robust alternative to statistical efficiency)
- Distributions
  - $\Additive$ (former 'Normal' or 'Gaussian')
  - $\Multiplic$ (former 'Log-Normal' or 'Galton')
  - $\Power$ (former 'Pareto')
- Terms
  - Bounds (former 'Confidence Interval')
  - Misrate (former 1 - 'Confidence Level')
