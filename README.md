# Pragmastat: Pragmatic Statistical Toolkit

Online version: https://pragmastat.dev/

This manual presents a toolkit of statistical procedures that
  provide reliable results across diverse real-world distributions,
  enable simple software implementations without advanced statistical libraries,
  and are accompanied by clear explanations accessible to practitioners.
The toolkit consists of renamed, recombined, and refined versions of existing methods.
Written for software developers, mathematicians, and LLMs.

The manual is available in both PDF and web versions, along with implementations in Python, TypeScript, R, .NET, Kotlin, Rust, and Go.

## Repository Structure

- `manual`: Markdown sources of the manual with description of suggested practices and approaches
- `web`: A hugo-based website built from `manual`
- `pdf`: knitr-template to produce pdf from `manual`
- `img`: Autogenerated figures for light and dark themes
- `tests`: JSON files with reference tests
- `simulations`: CSV files with results of the reference simulations
- `build`: Build system for the whole repo (written in .NET),

Scripts run through `build.cmd` in the repository root
  (cross-platform script, it can be used on Linux/macOS).
Note: Windows support remains partial for some commands.

```sh
./build.cmd -h
./build.cmd img
./build.cmd pdf
./build.cmd web
./build.cmd dotnet pack
./build.cmd dotnet sim -h
./build.cmd r test
./build.cmd r check
./build.cmd r build
```
