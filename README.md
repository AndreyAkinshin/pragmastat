# Pragmastat: Pragmatic Statistical Toolkit

Online version: https://pragmastat.dev/

This manual presents a unified statistical toolkit for reliable analysis of real-world data.
The toolkit
  nearly matches the efficiency of traditional statistical estimators under normality,
  maintains reasonable robustness against outliers,
  enables simple software implementations without advanced statistical libraries,
  and provides clear explanations accessible to practitioners without deep statistical training.
The toolkit consists of renamed, recombined, and refined versions of existing methods.
Written for mathematicians, software developers, and LLMs.

The manual is available in both PDF and web versions, along with implementations in Python, TypeScript, R, .NET, Kotlin, Rust, and Go.

## Repository Structure

- `manual`: Markdown sources of the manual with description of suggested practices and approaches
- `web`: A hugo-based website built from `manual`
- `pdf`: knitr-template to produce pdf from `manual`
- `img`: Autogenerated figures for light and dark themes
- `tests`: JSON files with reference tests
- `simulations`: CSV files with results of the reference simulations
- `build`: Build system for the whole repo (written in .NET),

Scripts run through `build.cmd` in the repository root
  (cross-platform script, it can be used on Linux/macOS).
Note: Windows support remains partial for some commands.

```sh
./build.cmd -h
./build.cmd img
./build.cmd pdf
./build.cmd web
./build.cmd dotnet pack
./build.cmd dotnet sim -h
./build.cmd r test
./build.cmd r check
./build.cmd r build
```
