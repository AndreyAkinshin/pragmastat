# Task: Technical Documentation Proofreading & Polish

## Objective

Review and improve all files in the @manual/ folder for quality, accuracy, and consistency.

## Scope

Read all files from @manual/ folder recursively and apply the following improvements:

### 1. Language Quality

- **Typos**: Correct spelling errors
- **Grammar**: Fix grammatical mistakes, verb tenses, subject-verb agreement
- **Punctuation**: Ensure proper punctuation usage
- **Clarity**: Improve sentence structure for better readability
- **Conciseness**: Remove unnecessary verbosity while maintaining completeness

### 2. Technical Accuracy

- **Mathematical notation**: Verify formulas, equations, and statistical notation
- **Code examples**: Check for syntax errors and consistency
- **Technical terminology**: Ensure correct usage of domain-specific terms
- **Cross-references**: Verify that internal links and references are accurate

### 3. Consistency

- **Terminology**: Use consistent terms throughout
- **Formatting**: Apply uniform heading styles, code blocks, and lists
- **Notation**: Maintain consistent mathematical and statistical notation
- **Voice**: Keep consistent tone

## Constraints

- **DO NOT** change technical content unless there's an obvious error
- **DO NOT** alter code that is demonstrably correct
- **DO NOT** change the overall structure or reorganize sections without identifying issues first
- **DO** preserve the author's voice and style where appropriate

## Process

1. First, scan all files to understand the documentation structure and terminology
2. Create a systematic list of issues found (categorized by type)
3. Fix issues incrementally, explaining significant changes
4. Report any ambiguous cases that need author clarification
